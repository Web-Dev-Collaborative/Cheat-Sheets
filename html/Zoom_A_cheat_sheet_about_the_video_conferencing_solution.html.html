  <p>Due to the <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-covid-19-is-disrupting-the-enterprise-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">COVID-19
      pandemic</a>, more people are working from home. With workforces scattered to the wind, many businesses have had
    to adapt to virtual meetings as the new normal, which has been a massive boon for the video chat and conferencing
    software Zoom.</p>
  <p>In February 2020, <a
      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/zoom-has-added-more-users-so-far-this-year-than-in-2019-bernstein.html">Zoom
      added more users</a> than it did in the entirety of 2019. Major media platforms started using Zoom to stream
    broadcasts from at-home anchors, and “Zooming” quickly became eponymous with video chats and virtual meetings. </p>

  <p>Zoom’s explosive growth came with increased focus on <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/keep-these-privacy-considerations-in-mind-when-using-zoom-at-home-for-work-collaboration/">security
      and privacy issues</a> that went largely unnoticed before. Major companies and governments around the world have
    been <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/who-has-banned-zoom-google-nasa-and-more/">banning Zoom</a> from
    work use, and half a million sets of user credentials have even been found <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/dark-web-cybercriminals-sell-half-a-million-zoom-accounts/">for sale on
      the Dark Web</a>.</p>
  <p>Zoom has pledged to fix <a
      href="https://www.cnet.com/news/zoom-every-security-issue-uncovered-in-the-video-chat-app/">a long list of
      security issues</a>, but that hasn’t stopped <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/35-of-zoom-users-fear-data-leaks-amid-the-platforms-security-issues/">a
      third of users</a> from getting cold feet. So, is Zoom still a video conferencing app worth using? If so, who
    should use it when so much personal and business security could be at risk? Learn more by reading this Zoom basics

  <h2 id="what-is-zoom">What is Zoom?</h2>
  <p>Zoom is video conferencing software for Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices that run iOS or Android. It
    supports one-on-one calls, as well as group meetings that can hold up to 100 users for free or 500 users with an
    additional purchase.</p>
  <p>Zoom, the company, was founded in 2011 by Eric Yuan, and the Zoom application was released in 2013. Zoom has been
    lauded for its simple interface, ease of use, and accessibility to non-tech savvy people, which has aided in its
    steady climb as a video conferencing app of choice for small businesses, enterprises, and individuals. By 2017, Zoom
    had grown into a unicorn company by reaching $1 billion in valuation. </p>
  <p>Along with its desktop and mobile apps, <a href="https://zoom.us/download">Zoom offers solutions</a> for enterprise
    conference rooms, browser extensions, online seminars, and a web client that allows meeting participants to attend
    meetings without having to install the Zoom app.</p>
  <p>Zoom has attracted many users by having a robust free tier, which allows meetings of up to 100 people without
    restricting any app features, instead limiting meetings for free accounts to 40 minutes.</p>

  <p>With the outbreak of the <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/coronavirus-critical-it-policies-and-tools-every-business-needs/">COVID-19
      pandemic</a>, Zoom saw a massive spike in users because of stay-at-home orders. By the end of March 2020, security
    issues started being reported. </p>
  <p>TechRepublic sister site CNET has a total rundown of <a
      href="https://www.cnet.com/news/zoom-every-security-issue-uncovered-in-the-video-chat-app/">all the security flaws
      discovered in Zoom</a> since March; here are some of the highlights.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>March 26:</strong> An investigation finds that Zoom is sending user data to Facebook without
        permission. Zoom removed its Facebook data collection the following day.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>March 30:</strong> Another investigation finds that Zoom is not using end-to-end encryption,  Zoom
        bombs are first reported, and multiple flaws in both the windows and macOS versions of Zoom are reported.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 1:</strong> Zoom is treating email addresses with the same domain (e.g., ISPs, but not email-only
        services like Gmail) as if they belong to the same company, allowing countless users access to names, photos,
        and email addresses of other users. Zoom CEO Eric Yuan issues a public apology, and Zoom freezes all feature
        rollouts to focus on security fixes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 2:</strong> A data mining feature is discovered that allows some users to gain access to LinkedIn
        profiles of other Zoom users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 3:</strong> Recordings of thousands of Zoom meetings, many containing private information, are
        found freely viewable and unsecured on the web. Zoom issues another apology, and reveals it’s using AES-128
        encryption instead of the much more secure AES-256.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 5:</strong> Zoom admits in a statement that some calls were being accidentally routed through a
        whitelisted server located in China.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 6:</strong> The first collection of Zoom accounts is found for sale on the dark web.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 13:</strong> A further 500,000 Zoom accounts are found for sale on the dark web, with many
        costing as little as a few cents.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 16:</strong> Two new privacy bugs are discovered: One allows an attacker to view and download
        Zoom meeting videos stored in the cloud via an unsecured link, and a second lets deleted meeting recordings be
        viewed in the cloud for hours after deletion.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 20:</strong> Former engineers at Zoom partner Dropbox revealed that the company knew of a 2019
        Mac exploit months before finally addressing it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 22:</strong> Security researchers discover a flaw in Zoom that, with the proper malware, could
        allow recording of a meeting without host or attendee knowledge, even if recording is disabled. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April 28:</strong> A US government intelligence report warns that Zoom could be vulnerable to spying by
        foreign governments.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>May 8:</strong> The New York Attorney General’s office closed its inquiry into Zoom’s security
        problems, citing increased security in Zoom 5.0 that led to the New York City Department of Education to allow
        it back into classrooms. Litigation continues in Connecticut and between Zoom and investors/shareholders.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zoom has issued numerous apologies and pledged to improve its security.</p>

        TechRepublic’s cheat sheets and smart person’s guides</strong></a></p>
  <p>Some of the security issues, like Zoom bombing, can be addressed by users <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-prevent-zoom-bombing-5-simple-tips/">taking steps to protect
      their video meetings</a>, and Zoom has enabled by default many of the security features needed to do so. Other
    issues like poor encryption, lack of end-to-end encryption during meetings, and account theft can’t be stopped by
    good Zoom user habits.</p>
  <p>Zoom released <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/zoom-5-0-how-to-better-secure-meetings-with-the-latest-features/">Zoom
      5.0 in late April 2020</a>, addressing many of the security issues listed above. Features and enhancements in Zoom
    5.0 include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>AES 256-bit encryption, which brings Zoom in-line with other video conferencing apps;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Data routing controls, which allow account administrators to control which data centers meetings are routed
        through, likely to address the accidental routing of calls to China;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The relocation of <a
          href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/08/zoom-product-updates-new-security-toolbar-icon-for-hosts-meeting-id-hidden/">security
          settings in one menu for meeting hosts</a>, located on the bottom bar during a Zoom call;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The waiting room is now on by default;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Meeting passwords are now on by default, and account admins can set their own password complexity rules;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Cloud recordings are now password protected;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Changes to contact sharing to eliminate contact information leaks; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Admin dashboard changes that allow administrators to track how meetings are connected to data centers;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Chat notifications can optionally not show a preview of messages;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Non-personal meeting ID codes have been lengthened to 11 digits; and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Invite options and meeting IDs have been relocated to the participants menu to make it harder to accidentally
        share meeting IDs.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zoom said that version 5.0 is <a
      href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/22/zoom-hits-milestone-on-90-day-security-plan-releases-zoom-5-0/">a
      key milestone in its 90-day security plan</a>, with Zoom CEO Eric Yuan saying the company is working to earn
    customers’ trust in the wake of a long list of security incidents.</p>
  <p>As of January 2021, Zoom is up to version 5.4.6, which has added <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/zoom-these-new-features-will-prevent-trolls-and-meeting-crashers/">additional
      security and quality of life features</a> such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The ability for hosts to pause audio, video, screen sharing, and text chat in order to remove disruptive
        members</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Participant activities, like breakout rooms, can also be closed at will</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The ability to report users has been added, which will boot them from a meeting and send an alert to Zoom’s
        Trust and Safety team.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Individual participants can also report disruptive users (this can be enabled or disabled by administrators)
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Several <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/zoom-announces-end-to-end-encryption-customizable-sdks-and-more-at-zoomtopia/">additional
      features were also announced at Zoomtopia</a>, Zoom’s online conference that took place in October 2020. These
    include: </p>

      <p>New customizable SDKs </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The introduction of Zapps (Zoom apps), which can be written by first- and third-party developers</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A new platform called OnZoom, which allows Zoom users to create monetized classes, fundraisers, performances,
        and other ticketed events for as many people as their particular license (free or paid) will allow</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zoom also announced new functions to its unified communication platform, including:</p>

  <p>How does Zoom compare to Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Google Hangouts?</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Zoom has a lot of competition, and its recent missteps have opened some very large windows for those competitors to
    step in and capture some of its market share. <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/top-10-zoom-alternatives-for-video-conferencing/">TechRepublic recently
      wrote about 10 Zoom alternatives</a>, and some of those options have even added Zoom-like features recently to
    draw away security-conscious users. </p>
  <p>Free video chat options similar to Zoom include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft Teams, the Microsoft 365-integrated video chat platform, has been <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/free">extended for free</a> to anyone with
      an email address, and Microsoft has lifted meeting user limits to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Until further notice, free meetings will support up to 300 people for up to 24 hours.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/">Skype video calls</a> can be attended by up to 100 people. For
      small business teams, this makes it an ideal option.</li>
    <li><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a> is free for individual users. Google’s enterprise
      product, Meet, is now <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-meet-goes-free-to-take-on-zoom-and-microsoft-teams/">free for

  <p>What are Zoom’s best features for business users?</p>
  <hr />
  <p>The allure of Zoom isn’t only in <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/zoom-tips-to-improve-your-video-conferences-while-telecommuting/">its
      myriad features</a>, but also in its incredible usability. Zoom is designed with non-tech people in mind: Its
    interface is simple, signing up is quick and hassle-free, and it works well with minimal user input. Anyone looking
    for a video conference solution for teams with people who don’t like, or are unfamiliar with, modern tech will find
    Zoom a great solution.</p>
  <p>Any business using Zoom or considering using it should keep an eye on tech news about security issues, and be sure
    to follow <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/keep-these-privacy-considerations-in-mind-when-using-zoom-at-home-for-work-collaboration/">best
      security practices</a> to protect your Zoom calls from unauthorized entry. Even with the addition of end-to-end
    encryption and other features, it’s important to ensure all the appropriate security options are enabled.</p>
  <p>If Zoom’s security troubles over the course of 2020 aren’t enough to dissuade you from adopting it for business web
    conferencing, there are several enterprise features worth considering.</p>
  <p>Video conferencing with Zoom, which is a free product with restrictions, can be upgraded with <a
      href="https://zoom.us/pricing">one of several plans</a> that expand its features to include more participants,
    additional security features (like SSO, user management, and administrator controls), and other features.</p>
  <p><a href="https://zoom.us/zoomrooms">Zoom Rooms</a> is one such offering. At $49 room/month, Zoom Rooms integrates
    with existing A/V hardware in meeting rooms and features many of the user-friendly aspects of the regular Zoom app
    at a larger scale. Zoom Rooms has one-touch meeting join, wireless sharing, interactive whiteboard support, and its
    own <a href="https://zoom.us/zoomrooms/hardware">scalable and supported hardware</a> that can adapt to meeting rooms
    of various sizes.</p>
  <p><a href="https://zoom.us/webinar">Zoom also has a webinar platform</a> that extends 100-person meetings to allow up
    to 10,000 view-only attendees. The 100 participants have the ability to use Zoom just like a regular call, making it
    ideal for panel discussions, media events, and education. </p>
  <p>There’s also <a href="https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/phonesystem.html">Zoom Phone</a>, a cloud-hosted enterprise
    phone-as-a-service platform that lets businesses offload their enterprise phone systems to free up a bit of server
    room space. Zoom Phone integrates with Salesforce, Office 365, and G Suite out of the box, and phone calls can be

    repair its reputation.</p>
