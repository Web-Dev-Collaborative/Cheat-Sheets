  <p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/artificial-intelligence-cheat-sheet/">Artificial intelligence</a>
    (AI), which has been around since the 1950s, has seen ebbs and flows in popularity over the last 60+ years. But
    today, with the recent explosion of big data, high-powered parallel processing, and advanced neural algorithms, we
    are seeing a renaissance in AI–and companies from Amazon to Facebook to Google are scrambling to take the lead.
    According to AI expert Roman Yampolskiy, 2016 was the year of “<a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/7-trends-for-artificial-intelligence-in-2016-like-2015-on-steroids/">AI
      on steroids</a>,” and its explosive growth hasn’t stopped.</p>
  <p>While there are different forms of AI, machine learning (ML) represents today’s most widely valued mechanism for
    reaching intelligence. Here’s what it means.</p>

  <h2 id="executive-summary"><strong>Executive summary</strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What is machine learning?</strong> Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Instead of
      relying on explicit programming, it is a system through which computers use a massive set of data and apply
      algorithms to “train” on–to teach themselves–and make predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>When did machine learning become popular?</strong> The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in the
      1950s by <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/alan-turing-the-man-behind-the-myth/">Alan Turing</a>.
      Machine learning became popular in the 1990s, and returned to the public eye when <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-deepmind-the-smart-persons-guide/">Google’s DeepMind</a> beat
      the world champion of <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/learn-to-play-go-the-worlds-oldest-and-most-strategic-game/">Go</a>
      in 2016. Since then, ML applications and machine learning’s popularity have only increased.</li>
    <li><strong>Why does machine learning matter?</strong> Machine learning systems are able to quickly apply knowledge
      and training from large data sets to excel at facial recognition, speech recognition, object recognition,
      translation, and many other tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Which industries use machine learning?</strong> Machine learning touches industries spanning from
      government to education to healthcare. It can be used by businesses focused on marketing, social media, customer
      service, driverless cars, and many more. It is now widely regarded as a core tool for decision making.</li>
    <li><strong>How do businesses use machine learning?</strong> Business applications of machine learning are numerous,
      but all boil down to one type of use: Processing, sorting, and finding patterns in huge amounts of data that would
      be impractical for humans to make sense of.</li>
    <li><strong>What are the security and ethical concerns about machine learning?</strong> AI has already been trained
      to bypass advanced antimalware software, and it has the potential to be a huge security risk in the future.
      Ethical concerns also abound, especially in relation to the loss of jobs and the practicality of allowing machines
      to make moral decisions like those that would be necessary in self-driving vehicles.</li>
    <li><strong>What machine learning tools are available?</strong> Businesses like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and
      others offer tools for machine learning. There are free platforms as well.</li>

  <h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>
  <p>Machine learning is a branch of AI. Other tools for reaching AI include rule-based engines, evolutionary
    algorithms, and Bayesian statistics. While many early AI programs, like IBM’s Deep Blue, which defeated Garry
    Kasparov in chess in 1997, were rule-based and dependent on human programming, machine learning is a tool through
    which computers have the ability to teach themselves, and set their own rules. In 2016, Google’s DeepMind beat the
    world champion in Go by using machine learning–training itself on a large data set of expert moves.</p>
  <p>There are several kinds of machine learning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In <strong>supervised learning</strong>, the “trainer” will present the computer with certain rules that connect
      an input (an object’s feature, like “smooth,” for example) with an output (the object itself, like a marble).</li>
    <li>In <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>, the computer is given inputs and is left alone to discover patterns.
    </li>
    <li>In <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, a computer system receives input continuously (in the case of a
      driverless car receiving input about the road, for example) and constantly is improving.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A massive amount of data is required to train algorithms for machine learning. First, the “training data” must be
    labeled (e.g., a GPS location attached to a photo). Then it is “classified.” This happens when features of the
    object in question are labeled and put into the system with a set of rules that lead to a prediction. For example,
    “red” and “round” are inputs into the system that leads to the output: Apple. Similarly, a learning algorithm could
    be left alone to create its own rules that will apply when it is provided with a large set of the object–like a
    group of apples, and the machine figures out that they have properties like “round” and “red” in common.</p>

        learning? Everything you need to know</strong></a> <strong>(ZDNet)</strong></p>
  <p>Many cases of machine learning involve “deep learning,” a subset of ML that uses algorithms that are layered, and
    form a network to process information and reach predictions. What distinguishes deep learning is the fact that the
    system can learn on its own, without human training.</p>

  <h2 id="why-does-machine-learning-matter">Why does machine learning matter?</h2>
  <p>Aside from the tremendous power machine learning has to beat humans at games like Jeopardy, chess, and Go, machine
    learning has many practical applications. Machine learning tools are used to translate messages on Facebook, spot
    faces from photos, and <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-maps-meets-ai-carnegie-mellons-terrapattern-can-find-and-map-every-pool-in-new-york-city/">find
      locations around the globe</a> that have certain geographic features. <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibm-watsons-latest-gig-improving-cancer-treatment-with-genomic-sequencing/">IBM
      Watson</a> is used to help doctors make cancer treatment decisions. Driverless cars use machine learning to gather
    information from the environment. Machine learning is also central to fraud prevention. Unsupervised machine
    learning, combined with human experts, has been proven to be very accurate in <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-one-ai-security-system-combines-humans-and-machine-learning-to-detect-cyberthreats/">detecting

  <p>While there are many potential benefits of AI, there are also concerns about its usage. Many worry that AI (like
    automation) will <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-is-destroying-more-jobs-than-it-creates-what-it-means-and-how-we-can-stop-it/">put
      human jobs at risk</a>. And whether or not AI replaces humans at work, it will definitely shift the kinds of jobs
    that are necessary. Machine learning’s requirement for labeled data, for example, has meant a <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-tech-turning-contract-work-into-the-future-of-employment/">huge need
      for humans to manually do the labeling</a>.</p>
  <p>As machine learning and AI in the workplace have evolved, many of its applications have centered on <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/70-of-customer-support-agents-believe-ai-will-free-them-to-focus-on-higher-value-work/">assisting
      workers rather than replacing them outright</a>. This was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which
    forced many companies to send large portions of their workforce home to work remotely, leading to <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/forrester-ai-and-automation-will-help-organizations-rethink-the-future-of-work/">AI

  <p>2017 was a huge year for growth in the capabilities of machine learning, and <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/6-reasons-why-ai-adoption-will-thrive-in-2019/">2018 set the stage</a>
    for explosive growth that, by early 2020, found that <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/85-of-organizations-are-using-ai-in-deployed-applications/">85% of
      businesses were using some form of AI</a> in their deployed applications. </p>
  <p>One of the things that may be holding that growth back, Deloitte said, is confusion–just what is machine learning
    capable of doing for businesses?</p>
  <p>There are numerous examples of how businesses are leveraging machine learning, and all of it breaks down to the
    same basic thing: Processing massive amounts of data to draw conclusions much faster than a team of data scientists
    ever could.</p>

      malware</a> to bypass AI-powered antimalware platforms.</p>
  <p>Several tech leaders, like Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Bill Gates, have expressed worries about how AI may be
    misused, and the importance of creating ethical AI. Evidenced by the disaster of <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-microsofts-tay-ai-bot-went-wrong/">Microsoft’s racist chatbot,
      Tay</a>, AI can go wrong if left unmonitored.</p>
  <p><strong>SEE: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-we-teach-machine-learning-privacy/">Machine learning as a
        service: Can privacy be taught?</a> (ZDNet)</strong></p>
  <p>Ethical concerns abound in the machine learning world as well; one example is a self-driving vehicle adaptation of
    the <a href="http://www.trolleydilemma.com/">trolley problem</a> thought experiment. In short, when <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/mits-moral-machine-crowdsources-decisions-about-autonomous-driving-but-experts-call-it-misguided/">a
      self-driving vehicle is presented with a choice</a> between killing its occupants or a pedestrian, which is the
    right choice to make? There’s no clear answer with philosophical problems like this one–no matter how the machine is
    programmed, it has to make a moral judgement about the value of human lives.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-sinister-timing-of-deepfakes-and-the-2020-election/">Deep fake
      videos</a>, which realistically replace one person’s face and/or voice with someone else’s based on photos and
    other recordings, have the potential to upset elections, insert unwilling people into pornography, and otherwise
    insert individuals into situtations they aren’t okay with. <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-deepfakes-are-a-real-threat-to-elections-and-society/">The
      far-reaching effects</a> of this machine learning-powered tool could be devastating.</p>
  <p>Along with whether giving learning machines the ability to make moral decisions is correct, or whether access to
    certain ML tools is socially dangerous, there are issues of the other major human cost likely to come with machine
    learning: Job loss.</p>
  <p>If the AI revolution is truly the next major shift in the world, there are a lot of jobs that will cease to exist,
    and it isn’t necessarily the ones you’d think. While many <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/50-of-low-skilled-jobs-will-be-replaced-by-ai-and-automation-report-claims/">low-skilled
      jobs are definitely at risk</a> of being eliminated, so are jobs that require a high degree of training but are
    based on simple concepts like pattern recognition.</p>
  <p><a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-ai-is-about-to-make-some-of-the-highest-paid-doctors-obsolete/">Radiologists,
      pathologists, oncologists</a>, and other similar professions are all based on finding and diagnosing
    irregularities, something that machine learning is particularly suited to do.</p>
  <p>There’s also the ethical concern of barrier to entry–while machine learning software itself isn’t expensive, <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-machine-learning-benefits-the-rich-and-everyone-else-is-toast/">only
      the largest enterprises in the world</a> have the vast stores of data necessary to properly train learning
    machines to provide reliable results.</p>
  <p>As time goes on, some experts predict that it’s going to become more difficult for smaller firms to make an impact,
    making machine learning primarily a game for the largest, wealthiest companies.</p>
