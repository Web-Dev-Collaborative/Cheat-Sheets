  <p>The rise of cloud computing provides businesses the ability to quickly provision computing resources without the
    costly and laborious task of building data centers, and without the costs of running servers with underutilized
    capacity due to variable workloads.</p>

  <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) was the first large vendor of easily affordable
    cloud infrastructure and services, and remains the single largest player in the cloud computing market. For
    startups, this low barrier to entry has enabled the rise of popular photo sharing services such as <a

  <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What is AWS?</strong> AWS is a collection of various cloud computing services and applications offered
      by Amazon.com. The most popular of these services include Elastic Compute Cloud (<a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>) and Simple Storage Service (<a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-s3-the-smart-persons-guide/">S3</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Why does AWS matter?</strong> AWS has no upfront costs or appreciable time delay in resource
      provisioning–capacity is available on demand. With a usage-based billing formula, it is an economical alternative
      to on-premises servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Who does AWS affect?</strong> AWS offers services relevant to any organization, large or small, with an
      internet presence or a need for private data storage and retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>When was AWS launched?</strong> The AWS platform launched in 2006, though new services and “regions”
      (data centers) have been added continually since launch.</li>
    <li><strong>What services compete with AWS?</strong> <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-azure-the-smart-persons-guide/">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-cloud-platform-the-smart-persons-guide/">Google Cloud
        Platform</a> are two of the top competitors to AWS.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I become an AWS engineer?</strong> Amazon has a formal certification available for AWS DevOps
      engineers, but the certification isn’t necessary to perform the job. Regardless, interested professionals need to
      learn how to manage AWS instances, which involves many different skills.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I get and use AWS?</strong> You can get started with AWS using the free tier, which allows
      limited free use for up to one year. S3 pricing starts at $0.023 per GB, while EC2 instances start at $0.0059 per
      hour (may vary by region).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>SEE: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/topic/smart-persons-guides/">All of TechRepublic’s cheat sheets
        and smart person’s guides</a></strong></p>
  <p>What is AWS? AWS is a platform consisting of a variety of cloud computing services offered by Amazon.com. Instead
    of building an in-house data center, or leasing general purpose servers from traditional data centers, the costs of
    resource provisioning on AWS reflect actual usage, not reserved capacity. The service in question is also a factor
    in billing–pricing varies based on the individual product and storage type.</p>
  <p>For example, pricing for S3 is divided into three tiers. In the US-East region, the standard storage tier starts at
    $0.023 per GB per month for the first 50 terabytes, with discounts thereafter. Infrequent access storage starts at
    $0.0125 per GB, and Glacier storage, designed to host backups and data archives, starts at $0.004 per GB.</p>
  <p>In addition to the aforementioned EC2 and S3 services, other services exist in the AWS portfolio. <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a>, a content-delivery network (CDN), mirrors resources at
    “edge locations” to improve page loading time. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Relational Database Service</a>
    (RDS) is a scalable database server that supports MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, as
    well as Amazon’s own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Aurora</a> implementation of MySQL. Similarly, <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> offers scalable NoSQL database support. <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> allows users to quickly deploy and manage
    applications in the cloud from preconfigured <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/containers-the-smart-persons-guide/">container</a> images.</p>
  <p>AWS also offers specialized resources that are applicable to specific use cases. Video stored on S3 can be easily
    transcoded for mobile devices using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/">Elastic Transcoder</a>, and
    for any process not yet automatable simple tasks can be completed by remote workers in <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/downloads/inside-amazon-s-clickworker-platform-how-half-a-million-people-are-being-paid-pennies-to-train-ai-pdf-download/">Mechanical
      Turk</a>--though, this is more crowd computing than cloud computing. <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-connect-is-a-cloud-based-call-center-you-can-launch-within-minutes/">Amazon
      Connect</a> is a cloud-based contact center service delivered through AWS, allowing businesses to scale to
    thousands of customer support agents.</p>

  <h2 id="why-does-aws-matter">Why does AWS matter?</h2>
  <p>AWS, like other cloud service providers, offers the ability to instantly provision computing resources on demand.
    Compared to the laborious task of planning and building on-site data center infrastructure, along with the requisite
    hardware upgrades, maintenance costs, server cooling requirements, electricity costs, and use of
    floorspace–particularly for offices in urban centers with associated real estate costs–the savings can add up very
    quickly.</p>
  <p>The benefit of AWS extends beyond cost, however. Managed services of AWS reduce the administrative burden of IT,
    freeing them to work on new projects rather than spending time on general system upkeep. For example, in RDS, the
    administrative console can be used to automatically apply security updates to the underlying software stack, as well
    as manage backups, snapshots, deployments in multiple availability zones, and seamlessly replace an instance in the
    event of hardware failure.</p>

        Lambda: A guide to the serverless computing framework (free PDF)</strong></a> <strong>(TechRepublic)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Amazon has made AWS a leader in cloud-based machine learning. Since launching a long list of <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/">AI-based services</a> at re:Invent in 2016 (mentioned above),
    Amazon has extended its offerings to make AWS competitive with Google’s <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/">Cloud AI</a>.</p>
  <p>Since 2016 Amazon has added services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">SageMaker</a>, which rapidly
    trains machine learning models for faster deployment, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/">AWS
      DeepLens</a>, a deep-learning enabled video camera.</p>
  <p>As the largest public cloud services provider, Amazon acts as a trendsetter for the industry. Their purchasing
    power and scale gives them the ability to influence the industry at large. As part of this, Amazon’s development of
    Arm-powered AWS Graviton CPUs is likely to result in an increased focus in open source on optimizations for server
    applications to harness the full power of the Arm architecture in a way in which smaller vendors would not be able
    to affect.</p>

  <p>Practically any organization that uses computers has a use case applicable to a service provided by AWS. Even for
    the most basic uses–such as using S3 Glacier for offsite backups–AWS is a compelling alternative to traditional
    solutions. While AWS started as a cloud-based replacement for simple storage and compute operations, it has expanded
    to cover practically every use case imaginable, with targeted services for databases, IoT development, business
    productivity, messaging, game development, virtual desktops, analytics, machine learning, and more.</p>
  <p><strong>SEE:</strong> <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/cloud-data-storage-policy/"><strong>Cloud Data
        Storage Policy</strong></a> <strong>(TechRepublic Premium)</strong></p>
  <p>Additionally, while established organizations likely have capital for traditional data center deployments,
    cash-strapped startups benefit from the absence of deployment costs and paying only for resources used, as opposed
    to paying for capacity provisioned, or being forced to pay for infrastructure hardware. Utilizing cloud service
    providers such as AWS also allows for scale as a company grows, as well as establishing cloud infrastructure early
    in its growth.</p>
  <p>Of note, Amazon’s largest brick-and-mortar competitor Walmart reportedly issued an ultimatum to suppliers and
    software vendors in 2017 to <a
      href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/walmart-takes-its-amazon-battle-to-the-clouds/">cease using AWS</a> for their
    businesses, at the risk of losing business with the big box retailer. While Walmart has contributed to the open
    source OpenStack platform, the company is not requiring its partners to use cloud services from a particular vendor.
  </p>
  <p>Since issuing that ultimatum Walmart has begun using Microsoft Azure, but the company has said <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/walmarts-big-bet-on-microsoft-azure-wont-kill-its-private-cloud-work-in-openstack/">it
      isn’t abandoning</a> its OpenStack investments as of July 2018; as of 2020, the <a
      href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-walmart-are-teaming-on-a-potential-tiktok-takeover-deal/">partnership

  <p>In November 2014, Amazon announced a plan to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/">transition
      AWS to 100% renewable energy</a>. By April 2015, one quarter of consumed energy was provided by renewable sources.
    At the end of 2016, over 40% of consumed energy was provided by renewable sources, while Amazon <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/">planned to reach 50% by the end of 2017</a>. Amazon
    announced that it had <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/sustainability-timeline/">surpassed
      50% renewable energy in 2018</a>, and in 2019 the company said it planned to build <a

  <h2 id="what-services-compete-with-aws">What services compete with AWS?</h2>
  <p>According to tech market research firm Canalys, <a
      href="https://www.canalys.com/static/press_release/2020/Canalys---Cloud-market-share-Q4-2019-and-full-year-2019.pdf">AWS
      comprised 32.4% of the public cloud market as of Q4 2019</a>, with Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, and IBM combined
    totaling less than 30% of the market.</p>
  <p>In much the same way that Amazon as an internet retailer is intended to be everything to everyone, so is AWS. While
    competing cloud services offer alternatives for general use cases of AWS, no competing cloud service has an exact
    replacement for every product included in AWS.</p>
  <p>In terms of scale, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, and IBM are certainly capable of handling any amount of data or
    compute tasks you can generate.</p>

  <p>For organizations looking to migrate from an on-premise SharePoint system, or with other deep dependencies on
    Microsoft products, Azure is likely the most compelling option for a seamless transition to the cloud.</p>
  <p>Google Cloud Platform’s core strengths are in machine learning, big data tools, and extensive container support.
  </p>
  <p>For IoT, the cloud provider market is still wide open, with tailored solutions available from <a

  <p><a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/three-resources-to-improve-your-understanding-of-aws-security-and-harden-cloud-deployments/">Developers
      can get started with AWS</a> using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">Free Tier</a>, which is available to
    anyone without restriction for the first 12 months. It features 750 hours per month of EC2 t.2 micro instances of
    Linux or Windows, as well as 5 GB of standard storage in S3 with 20,000 GET and 2,000 PUT requests.</p>
  <p>Also available is 25 GB of storage in DynamoDB with 25 units of write and read capacity each, which Amazon
    estimates to be sufficient to handle 200 million requests per month. It includes one million free requests per month
    in <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-lambda-the-smart-persons-guide/">Lambda</a>, and 20,000 free
    requests in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management</a>, and free access grants in a dozen other
    AWS services. After the 12 month unlimited period ends, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/faqs/?ft=n">some
      restrictions</a> take effect. Free tier users should be sure they know all the details about products they need
    that may be affected by the end of the free tier unlimited period.</p>
  <p>For startups, <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/aws-imagine-grants-offer-up-to-100000-in-cloud-services-to-non-profits/">various
      tiers of free credits (up to $100,000</a>) are available depending on your accelerator. These promotional credits
    can be applied to most AWS products, though are not usable with Mechanical Turk, AWS Marketplace, or some types of
    support requests.</p>
