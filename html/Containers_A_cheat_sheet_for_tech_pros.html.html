  <p>Containers have revolutionized the way many people view IT and the deployment of apps and services. But what
    exactly are containers?</p>
  <p>Containers are self-contained apps and services that IT admins can easily deploy and update. In many instances and
    applications, containers make things easier and more reliable and secure. Containers are also part of the backbone
    of Kubernetes. In fact, without containers, there’d be no Kubernetes.</p>
  <p>This primer is a quick way to get up to speed on containers. We’ll update this “living” guide periodically when
    news and methods pertaining to containers are released.</p>

  <h2 id="what-are-containers">What are containers?</h2>
  <p>In the simplest terms, containers are self-contained applications, packaged with their dependencies, that IT can
    easily deploy and update.</p>
  <p>Similar to VMs, containers remove the hardware dependency from the equation. Containers are easily distributed via
    a virtual platform, and they’re a way your company can save money, considering you now have the ability to roll out
    multiple applications and services that do not have their own hardware requirements.</p>
  <p>Containers are also a great means for deploying and scaling websites. Imagine your basic website (served on a VM)
    allows you to easily add web-based applications and/or services to expand your offerings; these applications and/or
    services could be added without requiring their dependencies to be met by the hosting computer. With this in place,
    you no longer have to worry that installing a new application will interfere with either the host computer or the
    host VM, as the container is a self-contained application.</p>
  <p>Sometimes people are confused about the differences between VMs and containers. Containers are not VMs, and Docker
    is not a container. The hierarchy looks something like this:</p>
  <p>Hardware &gt; host OS &gt; VM &gt; Docker &gt; container</p>
  <p>A container is served up by software (such as Docker), which exists on a VM (such as those run on <a
      href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> or,
    on a much larger scale, <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-web-services-the-smart-persons-guide/">AWS</a>) that is run on a
    host OS (such as <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>) running on adequate hardware. Containers can
    also be deployed on Kubernetes clusters, which make it much easier to manage them at scale.</p>
  <p>When you consider making containers part of your business plan, a local Docker installation isn’t the only game in
    town. Other services to consider are:</p>

  <h2 id="why-do-containers-matter">Why do containers matter?</h2>
  <p>The importance of containers starts at the server level. Imagine that everything you run on your server is done so
    efficiently that each running app and service doesn’t compete for precious host resources or directly affect the
    running of the host machine. That is where the benefit of containers begins. Because of the isolated nature of
    containers, an administrator doesn’t have to concern herself with each app or service interfering or affecting one
    another.</p>
  <p>Certain members of the corporate food chain will be more interested in containers’ cost effectiveness. Removing the
    cost of hardware from the equation, let’s see how much creating an environment for running containers would cost.
    Remember, we have our host OS, our VM platform, and the software by which we will deploy the containers. Let’s break
    it down with real-world solutions (understanding there are other options available for each).</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Host OS:</strong> Ubuntu Linux. Free.</li>
    <li><strong>VM platform:</strong> VirtualBox. Free.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment software:</strong> Docker. Free</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You could have a completed software stack, ready for the deployment of your containers, for free. If you opt to use
    <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> as your VM platform, there will be an associated cost. If you’re looking
    at a much larger deployment, there could be the added cost of a hosting service, such as <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-azure-the-smart-persons-guide/">Azure</a> or <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. But for small- to mid-sized businesses, container technology can be had on
    the cheap. Of course, if you add Kubernetes into the mix, there’s a significant learning curve involved.</p>

  <h2 id="who-do-containers-affect">Who do containers affect?</h2>
  <p>Containers affect IT pros (in their ease of use), end users (in their remarkable scope of service and reliability),
    and business owners (because they can save precious IT budget).</p>
  <p>More specifically, any business looking to grow its web presence by offering more and better services, or any
    company looking to empower its employees with Software as a Service, will be affected by containers. When companies
    have the ability to quickly roll out new applications or updates to existing applications, clients and end users
    also gain serious benefits.</p>

  <h2 id="how-do-i-start-using-containers">How do I start using containers?</h2>
  <p>If you’re interested in using containers, the first thing you must do is familiarize yourself with a tool such as
    Docker. In order to do that, you’ll want to have a fundamental understanding of Linux and how to write container
    manifests in JSON. You’ll also want to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes, as you’ll have a much easier time
    scaling your container deployments with that container management platform. Without understanding the foundational
    tools, you won’t be able to make use of what will probably be one of the most important pieces of your company’s
    technology puzzle moving forward.</p>
  <p>Once you have those technologies under your belt, you will be able to easily get Docker up and running in order to
    start deploying your containers.</p>
