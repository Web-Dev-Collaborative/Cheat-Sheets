**Unicode property escapes** [Regular
Expressions](../Regular_Expressions.html) allows for matching characters
based on their Unicode properties. A character is described by several
properties which are either binary (\"boolean-like\") or non-binary. For
instance, unicode property escapes can be used to match emojis,
punctuations, letters (even letters from specific languages or scripts),
etc.

<div>

</div>

::: {.blockIndicator .note}
**Note:** For Unicode property escapes to work, a regular expression
must use [the `u`
flag](../Regular_Expressions.html#Advanced_searching_with_flags) which
indicates a string must be considered as a series of Unicode code
points. See also `RegExp.prototype.unicode`.
:::

::: {.blockIndicator .note}
**Note:** Some Unicode properties encompasses much more characters than
some [character classes](Character_Classes.html) (such as `\w` which
matches only latin letters, `a` to `z`) but the latter is better
supported among browsers (as of January 2020).

::: {.blockIndicator .note}
**Note:** As there are many properties and values available, we will not
describe them exhaustively here but rather provide various examples
:::

Rationale {#Rationale}
---------

Before ES2018 there was no performance-efficient way to match characters
from different sets¬†based on `scripts` (like Macedonian,¬†Greek, Georgian
etc.) or `propertyName`¬†(like Emoji etc)¬†in JavaScript. Check out [tc39
Proposal on Unicode Property
Escapes](../../../../../../../external.html?link=https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes){.external}
for more info.

Examples {#Examples}
--------

### General categories {#General_categories}

General categories are used to classify Unicode characters and
subcategories are available to define a more precise categorization. It
is possible to use both short or long forms in Unicode property escapes.

They can be used to match letters, numbers, symbols, punctuations,
spaces, etc. For a more exhaustive list of general categories, please
refer to [the Unicode
specification](../../../../../../../external.html?link=https://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#General_Category_Property){.external}.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate}
// finding all the letters of a text
let story = "It‚Äôs the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.";

// Most explicit form
story.match(/\p{General_Category=Letter}/gu);

// It is not mandatory to use the property name for General categories
story.match(/\p{Letter}/gu);

// This is equivalent (short alias):
story.match(/\p{L}/gu);

// This is also equivalent (conjunction of all the subcategories using short aliases)
story.match(/\p{Lu}|\p{Ll}|\p{Lt}|\p{Lm}|\p{Lo}/gu);
```

### Scripts and script extensions {#Scripts_and_script_extensions}

Some languages use different scripts for their writing system. For
instance, English and Spanish are written using the Latin script while
Arabic and Russian are written with other scripts (respectively Arabic
and Cyrillic). The `Script` and `Script_Extensions` Unicode properties
allow regular expression to match characters according to the script
they are mainly used with (`Script`) or according to the set of scripts
they belong to (`Script_Extensions`).

For example, `A` belongs to the `Latin` script and `Œµ` to the `Greek`
script.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate}
let mixedCharacters = "aŒµ–õ";

// Using the canonical "long" name of the script
mixedCharacters.match(/\p{Script=Latin}/u); // a

// Using a short alias for the script
mixedCharacters.match(/\p{Script=Greek}/u); // Œµ

// Using the short name Sc for the Script property
mixedCharacters.match(/\p{Sc=Cyrillic}/u); // –õ
```

For more details, please refer to [the Unicode
specification](../../../../../../../external.html?link=https://unicode.org/reports/tr24/#Script){.external}
and the [Scripts table in the ECMAScript
specification](../../../../../../../external.html?link=https://tc39.es/ecma262/#table-unicode-script-values){.external}.

If a character is used in a limited set of scripts, the `Script`
property will only match for the \"predominant\" used script. If we want
to match characters based on a \"non-predominant\" script, we could use
the `Script_Extensions` property (`Scx` for short).

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate}
// Ÿ¢ is the digit 2 in Arabic-Indic notation
// while it is predominantly written within the Arabic script
// it can also be written in the Thaana script

"Ÿ¢".match(/\p{Script=Thaana}/u);
// null as Thaana is not the predominant script¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† super()

"Ÿ¢".match(/\p{Script_Extensions=Thaana}/u);
// ["Ÿ¢", index: 0, input: "Ÿ¢", groups: undefined]
```

### Unicode property escapes vs. character classes {#Unicode_property_escapes_vs._character_classes}

With JavaScript regular expressions, it is also possible to use
[character classes](Character_Classes.html) and especially `\w` or `\d`
to match letters or digits. However, such forms only match characters
from the *Latin* script (in other words, `a` to `z` and `A` to `Z` for
`\w` and `0` to `9` for `\d`). As shown in [this
example](Character_Classes.html#Looking_for_a_word_from_Unicode_characters),
it might be a bit clumsy to work with non Latin texts.

Unicode property escapes categories encompass much more characters and
`\p{Letter}` or `\p{Number}` will work for any script.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate}
// Trying to use ranges to avoid \w limitations:

const nonEnglishText = "–ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ê–ª–∏—Å—ã –≤ –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ —á—É–¥–µ—Å";
const regexpBMPWord = /([\u0000-\u0019\u0021-\uFFFF])+/gu;
// BMP goes through U+0000 to U+FFFF but space is U+0020

console.table(nonEnglishText.match(regexpBMPWord));

// Using Unicode property escapes instead
const regexpUPE = /\p{L}+/gu;
console.table(nonEnglishText.match(regexpUPE));
```
