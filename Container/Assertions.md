### Boundary-type assertions {#Boundary-type_assertions}

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Characters | Meaning |
+===================================+===================================+
| `^` | Matches the beginning of input. |
| | If the multiline flag is set to |
| | true, also matches immediately |
| | after a line break character. For |
| | example, `/^A/` does not match |
| | the \"A\" in \"an A\", but does |
| | match the first \"A\" in \"An |
| | A\". |
| | |
| | ::: {.blockIndicator .note} |
| | This character has a different |
| | meaning when it appears at the |
| | start of a |
| | [group](Groups_and_Ranges.html). |
| | ::: |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `$` | Matches the end of input. If the |
| | multiline flag is set to true, |
| | also matches immediately before a |
| | line break character. For |
| | example, `/t$/` does not match |
| | the \"t\" in \"eater\", but does |
| | match it in \"eat\". |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `\b` | Matches a word boundary. This is |
| | the position where a word |
| | character is not followed or |
| | preceded by another |
| | word-character, such as between a |
| | letter and a space. Note that a |
| | matched word boundary is not |
| | included in the match. In other |
| | words, the length of a matched |
| | word boundary is zero. |
| | |
| | Examples: |
| | |
| | - `/\bm/`¬†matches the \"m\" in |
| | \"moon\". |
| | - `/oo\b/`¬†does not match the |
| | \"oo\" in \"moon\", because |
| | \"oo\" is followed by \"n\" |
| | which is a word character. |
| | - `/oon\b/`¬†matches the \"oon\" |
| | in \"moon\", because \"oon\" |
| | is the end of the string, |
| | thus not followed by a word |
| | character. |
| | - `/\w\b\w/`¬†will never match |
| | anything, because a word |
| | character can never be |
| | followed by both a non-word |
| | and a word character. |
| | |
| | To match a backspace character |
| | (`[\b]`), see [Character |
| | Classes](Character_Classes.html). |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `\B` | Matches a non-word boundary. This |
| | is a position where the previous |
| | and next character are of the |
| | same type: Either both must be |
| | words, or both must be non-words, |
| | for example between two letters |
| | or between two spaces.¬†The |
| | beginning and end of a string are |
| | considered non-words. Same as the |
| | matched word boundary, the |
| | matched non-word boundary is also |
| | not included in the match. For |
| | example, `/\Bon/` matches \"on\" |
| | in \"at noon\", and `/ye\B/` |
| | matches \"ye\" in \"possibly |
| | yesterday\". |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Other assertions {#Other_assertions}

::: {.blockIndicator .note}
**Note**: The `?` character may also be used as a quantifier.
:::

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Characters | Meaning |
+===================================+===================================+
| `x(?=y)` | **Lookahead assertion:¬†**Matches |
| | \"x\" only if \"x\" is followed |
| | by \"y\". For example, |
| | /`Jack(?=Sprat)/` matches |
| | \"Jack\" only if it is followed |
| | by \"Sprat\".\ |
| | `/Jack(?=Sprat|Frost)/` matches |
| | \"Jack\" only if it is followed |
| | by \"Sprat\" or \"Frost\". |
| | However, neither \"Sprat\" nor |
| | \"Frost\" is part of the match |
| | results. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `x(?!y)` | **Negative lookahead |
| | assertion:¬†**Matches \"x\" only |
| | if \"x\" is not followed by |
| | \"y\".¬†For example, `/\d+(?!\.)/` |
| | matches a number only if it is |
| | not followed by a decimal |
| | point.¬†`/\d+(?!\.)/.exec('3.141') | | | ` |
| | matches \"141\" but not \"3. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `(?<=y)x` | **Lookbehind assertion:¬†**Matches |
| | \"x\" only if \"x\" is |
| | preceded¬†by \"y\".¬†For example, |
| | `/(?<=Jack)Sprat/` matches |
| | \"Sprat\" only if it is preceded |
| | by |
| | \"Jack\".¬†`/(?<=Jack|Tom)Sprat/` |
| | matches \"Sprat\" only if it is |
| | preceded by \"Jack\" or \"Tom\". |
| | However, neither \"Jack\" nor |
| | \"Tom\" is part of the match |
| | results. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `(?<!y)x` | **Negative lookbehind |
| | assertion:¬†**Matches \"x\" only |
| | if \"x\" is not preceded¬†by |
| | \"y\".¬†For example, `/(?<!-)\d+/` |
| | matches a number only if it is |
| | not preceded by a minus |
| | sign.¬†`/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('3')` |
| | matches |
| | \"3\".¬†`/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('-3')` |
| | ¬†match is not found because |
| | the¬†number is preceded by the |
| | minus sign. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

## Examples {#Examples}

### General boundary-type overview example {#General_boundary-type_overview_example}

```{.brush: .js}
// Using Regex boundaries to fix buggy string.
buggyMultiline = `tey, ihe light-greon apple
tangs on ihe greon traa`;

// 1) Use ^ to fix the matching at the begining of the string, and right after newline.
buggyMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/^t/gim,'h');
console.log(1, buggyMultiline); // fix 'tey', 'tangs' => 'hey', 'hangs'. Avoid 'traa'.

// 2) Use $ to fix matching at the end of the text.
buggyMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/aa$/gim,'ee.');
console.log(2, buggyMultiline); // fix  'traa' => 'tree'.

// 3) Use \b to match characters right on border between a word and a space.
buggyMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/\bi/gim,'t');
console.log(3, buggyMultiline); // fix  'ihe' but does not touch 'light'.

// 4) Use \B to match characters inside borders of an entity.
fixedMultiline = buggyMultiline.replace(/\Bo/gim,'e');
console.log(4, fixedMultiline); // fix  'greon' but does not touch 'on'.
```

### Matching the beginning of input using a \^¬†control character {#Matching_the_beginning_of_input_using_a_control_character}

Use `^`¬†for¬†matching at the beginning of input. In this example, we can
get the fruits that start with \'A\' by a¬†`/^A/`¬†regex.¬†For selecting
appropriate fruits we can use the
[filter](../../Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter.html) method with
an [arrow](../../Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions.html) function.

```{.brush: .js}
let fruits = ["Apple", "Watermelon", "Orange", "Avocado", "Strawberry"];

// Select fruits started with 'A' by /^A/ Regex.
// Here '^' control symbol used only in one role: Matching beginning of an input.

let fruitsStartsWithA = fruits.filter(fruit => /^A/.test(fruit));
console.log(fruitsStartsWithA); // [ 'Apple', 'Avocado' ]
```

In the second example `^`¬†is used both for matching at the beginning of
input¬†and for creating¬†negated or complemented character sets when used
within [groups](Groups_and_Ranges.html).

```{.brush: .js}
let fruits = ["Apple", "Watermelon", "Orange", "Avocado", "Strawberry"];

// Selecting fruits that dose not start by 'A' by a /^[^A]/ regex.
// In this example, two meanings of '^' control symbol are represented:
// 1) Matching begining of the input
// 2) A negated or complemented character set: [^A]
// That is, it matches anything that is not enclosed in the brackets.

let fruitsStartsWithNotA = fruits.filter(fruit => /^[^A]/.test(fruit));

console.log(fruitsStartsWithNotA); // [ 'Watermelon', 'Orange', 'Strawberry' ]
```

### Matching a word boundary {#Matching_a_word_boundary}

```{.brush: .js}
let fruitsWithDescription = ["Red apple", "Orange orange", "Green Avocado"];

// Select descriptions that contains 'en' or 'ed' words endings:
let enEdSelection = fruitsWithDescription.filter(descr => /(en|ed)\b/.test(descr));

console.log(enEdSelection); // [ 'Red apple', 'Green Avocado' ]
```

### Lookahead assertion {#Lookahead_assertion}

```{.brush: .js}
// JS Lookahead assertion x(?=y)

let regex = /First(?= test)/g;

console.log('First test'.match(regex)); // [ 'First' ]
console.log('First peach'.match(regex)); // null
console.log('This is a First test in a year.'.match(regex)); // [ 'First' ]
console.log('This is a First peach in a month.'.match(regex)); // null
```

### Basic negative lookahead assertion {#Basic_negative_lookahead_assertion}

For example, `/\d+(?!\.)/` matches a number only if it is not followed
by a decimal point.¬†`/\d+(?!\.)/.exec('3.141')` matches \"141\" but not
\"3.

```{.brush: .js}
console.log(/\d+(?!\.)/g.exec('3.141')); // [ '141', index: 2, input: '3.141' ]
```

### Different meaning of¬†\'?!\' combination usage in Assertions and ¬†Ranges¬† {#Different*meaning_of*!\_combination_usage_in_Assertions_and_Ranges}

Different meaning of¬†`?!`¬†combination usage in
[Assertions](Assertions.html) `/x(?!y)/ `and
[Ranges](Groups_and_Ranges.html) `[^?!]`.

```{.brush: .js}
let orangeNotLemon = "Do you want to have an orange? Yes, I do not want to have a lemon!";

// Different meaning of '?!' combination usage in Assertions /x(?!y)/ and  Ranges /[^?!]/
let selectNotLemonRegex = /[^?!]+have(?! a lemon)[^?!]+[?!]/gi
console.log(orangeNotLemon.match(selectNotLemonRegex)); // [ 'Do you want to have an orange?' ]

let selectNotOrangeRegex = /[^?!]+have(?! an orange)[^?!]+[?!]/gi
console.log(orangeNotLemon.match(selectNotOrangeRegex)); // [ ' Yes, I do not want to have a lemon!' ]
```

### Lookbehind assertion {#Lookbehind_assertion}

```{.brush: .js}
let oranges = ['ripe orange A ', 'green orange B', 'ripe orange C',];

let ripe_oranges = oranges.filter( fruit => fruit.match(/(?<=ripe )orange/));
console.log(ripe_oranges); // [ 'ripe orange A ', 'ripe orange C' ]
```
